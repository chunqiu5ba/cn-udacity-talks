00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,439
>> Hi again！>> Hi again!

3
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:18,530
>> Hi Sebastian! Astro!
>> Hi again！>> Hi again!

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,530
>> Hi Sebastian! Astro!

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,360
It's my unbelievable pleasure and a privilege to

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,610
present my best friend, longtime friend --

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,899
Astro Teller -- grand sum of infinitely

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,070
noble Lords of similar names: head of

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,230
Google X, now X labs, and general genius

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,229
and wonderful human being to you. Some of

11
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,440
you might know him, but welcome. >> Thank you

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,760
very much. My very first question I can't

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,739
help is, what's this with this jacket?

14
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,859
>> This is just what I put on this morning.

15
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,220
But in fact I got this jacket, I think

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,590
someone was trying to prank me. They gave

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,710
me this jacket and I mean, in Craig

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,060
Barrett who at the time also worked at

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,880
Alphabet. A matching jacket it wasn't an

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,180
r2d2 jacket, it was a wiki jacket so it

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,830
had like the bandolier across here, and

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,420
like the pull up the hood and was all

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,670
fuzzy, and he just said no way, I'm not

24
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,350
wearing that. Because we were going to

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,300
spend a day. I'm seeing an event kind of

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,340
like this together, that he didn't wear

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,440
it and I just thought, you know, it's a

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,840
little bit lame, I'm gonna wear my r2d2

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,940
jacket, so even though, I mean I'm into

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,320
Star Wars, but I'm not super into Star

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,830
Wars, but if I work for the day just for

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,360
fun, I don't know, and then I got into it.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,070
I'm just enjoying being a robot, I guess.

34
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,020
I guess you are robots? >> Just

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,450
kidding. >> But you just joined us as a

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,000
hiring partner. >> Yes we did!

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,330
>> That is great too.

38
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,900
I think shortly after I got fired, I

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,460
think this became the best place to work

40
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,520
in Silicon Vally. >> No, that's a total

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,190
coincidence. >> What are you hiring?

42
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,650
>> Well, we are hiring lots of things. We're

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,480
certainly hiring roboticists, we care a

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,060
lot about machine learning, a lot of the

45
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,790
work that we do at X is systems

46
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,160
integration work. We don't do a lot of

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,130
basic science essentially, but we work on

48
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,990
problems that haven't been solved before.

49
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,090
And so a lot of that turns out to be

50
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,410
complex iterative system integration

51
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,170
kind of work, taking pieces that already

52
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,550
exists in the world, sometimes that

53
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,040
custom versions of them have to be made,

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,930
and putting together in unusual ways,

55
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,150
getting it out in the world, trying,

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,670
you've discovered that you're wrong, and

57
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,100
you make a new design, you repeat, is the

58
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,780
sort of general way that it feels I

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,180
think for all of the X projects. So

60
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,590
people who are good at that.

61
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,040
>> I want to take you 50 years in

62
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
the future, tell me what's gonna be.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,540
>> Awesome, let's go. >> I don't obey this law

64
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,340
what's gonna be interesting in 50 years?

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,360
>> I think the world is going to be

66
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,510
almost unrecognizable in 20. So... >> it's gonna be bad ?

67
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,269
>> I'm sure it'll be a mix, I think

68
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,970
mainly it'll be a pretty exciting and

69
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,800
mostly positive place. I'm sure it's

70
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
going to be disorienting getting there.

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,100
>> They talk about a nuclear winter.

72
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,900
>> I don't know, I think that the world is

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,720
going to turn out to surprise us more

74
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,730
positively than negatively. But the world

75
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,010
is going to be incredibly different 20

76
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,890
years. The saying is, and I think that

77
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,170
this is correct, that people tend to

78
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,750
overestimate the progress of Technology

79
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,540
and the rate of change in the short term,

80
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,180
that is three years from now, they think

81
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,560
the world would be more different than

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,410
it is. And they underestimate it in the

83
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,530
medium term, over 10 to 20 years, I think

84
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,600
we all collectively can't really imagine

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,730
how different it will be. My rule of

86
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,890
thumb would be, 20 years from now ought

87
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,959
to be roughly like a hundred years in

88
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,120
the past. So if you can imagine the last

89
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,760
hundred years of change and next twenty,

90
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,250
I think that that's probably a realistic estimate

91
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,900
for how different the world will feel.

92
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,940
>> Wow that means people have to learn

93
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,790
a lot along the way. >> Yes. I think our

94
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,549
society is not yet wired for the rate of

95
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,170
change that we're going to be

96
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,269
experiencing. >> One thing it always

97
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,340
impresses me on yours is your attitude

98
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,820
towards innovation and specifically

99
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,880
things like fear and failure and so on.

100
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,970
You celebrate when you fire people over

101
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,310
for its fears, is that correct? >> Yeah I

102
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,200
mean, I'm not sure we would celebrate

103
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,620
letting someone go. Though, sometimes it

104
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,900
is the case that we helped people to go

105
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,540
to a place that is better for them, and I

106
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,419
have, at least on occasion had them...

107
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,360
>> Liberate them. >> Yes absolutely. It is

108
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,050
sometimes the case, that, you know, Susie

109
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,360
can be great somewhere, but the place she

110
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,700
currently is is not where she can be

111
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,419
great, and it is a favor to Susie's team

112
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,169
and to myself, but also to Susie, to tell

113
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,570
that to Susie. Certainly not telling her

114
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,130
that and letting her just suffer

115
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,590
indefinitely being not excellent when

116
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,030
she has the capacity to be excellent,

117
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,950
it's not doing anybody, particularly

118
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,870
Susie, a favor. >> You do that, by the way,

119
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,479
all our students.. >> Liberating all

120
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,580
of them ? >> You can graduate them. >> Yes,

121
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,320
well, I do the same thing with our projects.

122
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,360
>> Yes, Stanford doesn't remember.. we

123
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,220
have these wonderful pompous moment

124
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,360
when we kick out every student. >> I think

125
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,010
the parents come just elevator with him

126
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,450
about this. >> That's why we call a

127
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,940
graduation for the project and X so

128
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,140
instead of feeling like they're being

129
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,360
kicked out of Eden, they feel a little

130
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,650
bit more like they're leaving home and

131
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,919
going to college hopefully. >> Steve

132
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,169
Blankie before a NASA wanna ask a

133
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,000
question, and I want to ask you the same

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,390
question. I want you to go back to

135
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,090
your 18 years old self, when you

136
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,940
just enter in college, what advice would

137
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,440
you give yourself. >> You know, one of the

138
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,470
things that I think about frequently if

139
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,810
I could go back and change something, it

140
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,940
was a little moment, but it's become

141
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,680
actually bigger for me over time instead

142
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
of smaller. I was a junior, so maybe nine

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,710
twenty-something, 20 years old

144
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,980
probably at Stanford. My brother had

145
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,360
just got into Stanford, he was a freshman,

146
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,820
he was doing an undergraduate degree in

147
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,400
physics but he was spending actually

148
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,440
more of his time doing acting, being a

149
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,110
thespian than being doing his physics

150
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,350
degree. I was getting to know his

151
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,300
mentor whose name's Winter Meade.

152
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,090
After one of the shows, Winter came up

153
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,190
to me and he said, you'd be great in the

154
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,200
theater, you should really join the

155
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,030
company and do something. And I said, oh

156
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,240
no, I'm really busy, I had some set of

157
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,000
excuses, and I was really busy. That's not

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,530
why I said no. I was afraid. I just I

159
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,270
don't know, I think was probably because

160
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,730
it wasn’t important to me. And I've

161
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,340
regretted that ever since. Not because I

162
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,840
want to be in the theater, it just

163
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,970
bothers me. It's one of the few things in

164
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,490
my life I didn't do, because I was afraid.

165
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,800
And I know I didn't do it because I was

166
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,050
afraid. And I thought ever since, I'm not

167
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,330
doing that. I can fail for all kinds of

168
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,010
reasons, but I'm not going to fail again

169
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,560
cuz I was just too afraid to try. >> So now

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,630
when you’re afraid, you do it? >> Yeah I am

171
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,280
actually counter phobic… >> How can you

172
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,970
drive a car. >> I'm not afraid to track a

173
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,979
car I really, actually, but I'm not yet to

174
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:39,530
run a red light. >> Different story. You've

175
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,690
done an unbelievably amazing job as the

176
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,350
key of Silicon Valley, the magician who

177
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,200
puts balloon into the stratosphere. Does

178
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,910
self-driving cars and whatever it is

179
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,360
that you've been doing in X. What is your

180
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,690
vessel tank, and maybe I take a

181
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,340
tiny bit of credit as well, but what's

182
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,540
your recipe, not so true, to this

183
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,090
organization evolves and matures and

184
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,030
quite frankly gets larger in size ,to

185
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,919
keep it fresh. How do you keep the

186
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,600
innovative genes going. >> I think a lot

187
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,060
about all the tensions that we have at X,

188
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,610
and some of the tensions are fairly

189
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,050
straightforward, some of them less

190
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,660
straightforward. But for example, we have

191
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,200
to have raging optimism or we would

192
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,930
never try the things that we try. But if

193
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,649
you just

194
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,139
power people have raging optimism, go

195
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,509
forth, be crazy, the crazier the better.

196
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,579
Without limits, you are not going to get

197
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,249
good results. So there has to be a kind

198
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:46,790
of scathing paranoia and skepticism that

199
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,329
balances out that optimism. You have to

200
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,649
keep those in balance if you're actually

201
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,410
going to get what you want. But that's

202
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,059
not the only kind of tension that we

203
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:00,110
have. Another one is the.. you know, what

204
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,519
you could say, positively would be to

205
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,949
support structures at X, or if you want

206
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:05,689
to be negative about it, the bureaucracy

207
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:08,569
at X. So we want to bring to bear on

208
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:11,389
projects the right help at the right

209
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,480
time, to amplify them or to help, you know,

210
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,759
move them on to a better path when

211
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,350
they're sort of veering off of the path.

212
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,410
In the best-case scenarios, that's

213
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,819
wonderful, of course, it sounds really

214
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:24,529
positive the way I just said that. But if

215
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,029
it's done wrong, it sure feels like

216
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:28,249
bureaucracy to the project leads. And

217
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,290
they sometimes express that to me, and

218
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,240
the bureaucracy is the last thing that I

219
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,459
want to produce. So that's another

220
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,160
example where having no structure

221
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,569
doesn't make any sense. Then we're just a

222
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:39,649
venture capitalist, we're just giving

223
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,300
people money and walking away. That

224
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,279
doesn't makes sense for us to do that.

225
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,949
But if we smother them with the tention, if

226
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:47,660
I think that I know how to do their job

227
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,730
better than them, one of us is redundant,

228
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,860
like that's a bad plan, so getting that

229
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,639
light touch is another example where

230
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,889
both ends of the spectrum are bad, and

231
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,029
there's somewhere in the middle that's

232
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:00,620
right and we're always sort of searching

233
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,089
for it. >>A lot of students and

234
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:07,519
partners came from, I think over 20

235
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,920
countries, which is amazing, including places

236
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,050
as always Jordan, Estonia. What is the

237
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,299
magic of Silicon Valley, and what can you

238
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,559
take home for different countries.

239
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,069
>> There's something in the water here

240
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:24,620
that's certainly palpable I think for

241
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,079
the people. >> I'm not

242
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,399
actually suggesting taking the water

243
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,070
home. You know what,

244
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,950
one of the ways, that is not my favorite

245
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,990
phraseology, but I've heard it frequently

246
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,890
is a culture of creative destruction. And

247
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,110
so that's not what I would take home, but

248
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,760
I think that that's what you might hear

249
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,220
frequently. One of the ways I might

250
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,850
prefer it, would be a healthy embrace of

251
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,240
failure. So someone was just asking me as

252
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,450
a Korean newspaper as asking me how can

253
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,240
the companies in Korea do better, they

254
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,770
feel really afraid to take risks because

255
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,400
they might look bad. And I don't know

256
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,990
this is true, but this was a suggestion I

257
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,780
gave yesterday morning, to this reporter

258
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,930
to take back to companies in Korea, which

259
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,830
was, it's not that we want to look bad in

260
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,180
Silicon Valley. I don't think that's it

261
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,900
at all. But I'm willing to look

262
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,160
arbitrarily stupid right now, if that's

263
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,410
what it takes to win in the long run. I

264
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,870
think it's a time horizon difference. If

265
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,900
you understand and can connect that

266
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,930
being open to being wrong now is the

267
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,020
essence of learning, and that learning is

268
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,120
the superpower that causes you to win,

269
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,230
then you become hungry to be wrong and

270
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,170
to start over, and to try new things now,

271
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,270
no matter how imperfect it makes you

272
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,640
look in the short term, because your time

273
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,730
horizon on which you're unwilling to

274
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,880
lose, is very long. And so I think, even

275
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,950
though there is a culture of speed in

276
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,590
Silicon Valley, I believe that the length

277
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,050
of the time horizon over which people

278
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,390
are trying to optimize themselves being

279
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,070
longer, may actually be part of the

280
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,250
secret sauce. >> We have microphones and I

281
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,800
want to open up for audience question in

282
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,960
a minute. So if you want to line up

283
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,490
between these two microphones piece as

284
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,070
usual. But I have one question, by

285
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,870
dividing up tell us about his son.

286
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,610
>> So he's referring to the fact that my

287
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,670
son finished his first nanodegree a

288
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,560
little over a year ago, his name is

289
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,230
Griffin teller, and he did the

290
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,790
introduction of computer science, he

291
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,410
really enjoyed it, he was

292
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,440
just during 12 when he finished it, and

293
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,220
he's struggling his way here working

294
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,480
hard and our little struggling might not

295
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,519
be fair, even through the machine

296
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,550
learning course. And I just...

297
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,350
I told Sebastian this over

298
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,269
dinner last week, and he said, oh that's

299
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:01,949
actually one of the really hard courses.

300
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,509
And I went home and said, you know,

301
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,550
Griffin, you're going pretty slowly

302
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,500
through it. Sebastian says that's one of

303
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,939
the really hard ones, you want to ask for

304
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,259
help? Do you want to switch to one that's

305
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,449
easier? He's like, no, no, I got it. I

306
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,310
just... I have to like go back and like

307
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,750
learn a whole bunch of extra math, every

308
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,310
time I get to the next phase. He's 13 now, so..

309
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,399
But I'm very very grateful to Udacity,

310
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,610
because Griffin's a brave boy, and he's

311
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,610
hard-working, and he's focused, but that

312
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,560
by itself I was just saying back in the

313
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,360
green room, wouldn't actually have

314
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,339
translated to something like this. I

315
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,629
don't think it's an accident that he's

316
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,339
not doing chemistry or physics or

317
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,740
history, there isn't a platform for

318
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,350
supporting him doing that. And Udacity

319
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,019
has actually provided him with just the

320
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,579
right kind of structure, so he has to

321
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,370
work hard, he can self paces learning, it

322
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,750
means a huge amount to him. It's

323
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,100
actually part of why I'm here today. >> Yeah

324
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,199
we have over 20 recruiter both sides, and

325
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,910
I think you should bring him here and

326
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,759
talk to them. >> Excellent. otherwise over

327
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,060
tuition tax. Let's start in the center.

328
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,180
>> Hello Dr. Teller, could you perhaps share

329
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,550
a little bit about the use of

330
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,670
reinforcement learning in hedge fund, perhaps?

331
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,160
>> Reinforcement learning in which domain?

332
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,709
>> In hedge fund or financial. >> Hedge funds.

333
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,180
I'm not sure reinforcement learning is...

334
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,439
The only issue, let me answer or

335
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:33,779
generally the time I believe where the

336
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,360
application of machine learning in many

337
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,930
domains to the individual problems as

338
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,339
posed by humans is ending it'll go away

339
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,079
over you know 10 or 20 years it won't

340
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,360
happen overnight the thing which is

341
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,459
starting to be the case and one of the

342
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,750
areas in which you can see this

343
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,639
happening is hedge funds is where the

344
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,790
questions themselves are being asked by

345
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,570
machine learn

346
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,540
now it often won't look like and machine

347
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,040
learning being you know deep nets and

348
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,300
reinforcement learning and a number of

349
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,980
other tools it's sometimes won't look

350
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,650
like the question is being asked but

351
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,010
when you do end-to-end learning of any

352
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,950
kind in any domain you are essentially

353
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,200
leaving up to the system that's doing

354
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,040
the learning more of the decomposition

355
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,710
of the problem to the computer to the

356
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,320
learning system that that's part of the

357
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,840
task the feature izing of the data the

358
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,850
decomposition of the problem that's what

359
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,890
humans used to do and so I think that

360
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,050
movement is something we're going to see

361
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,290
a lot more of at computers essentially

362
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,480
starting to ask the questions and

363
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,150
structure the problem as well as

364
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,370
actually solving the problem and hedge

365
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,780
funds is definitely one of the areas in

366
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,390
which that's happening all right thank

367
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,390
you so much would you summarize your

368
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,960
view of failure on failure as fail fast

369
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,190
learn faster yeah I mean fail fast is

370
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,670
lip service which is thrown around very

371
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,920
liberally all around the valley and

372
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,900
other places and I think it largely does

373
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,960
not get people what they want and so

374
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,550
there's something wrong with the term

375
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,160
fail fast but that and the dollar fifty

376
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,640
will get you on the bus the problem is

377
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,220
that there's the lip service of whatever

378
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,710
you say like fail fast and then there's

379
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,690
the actual way that people behave and

380
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,760
the reason that those pointers are so

381
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,590
different is because these are the

382
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,380
emotional paths of least resistance in

383
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,200
your organization and you can say fail

384
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,870
fast until the cows come home but if you

385
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,880
punish people in fact if you do anything

386
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,070
short of actively rewarding them when

387
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,170
they fail it doesn't matter that you say

388
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,840
fail fast so what do you mean it when

389
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,540
you say fail fast and so we have

390
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,600
mechanisms at X to reward people when

391
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,460
they stand up and they say that was a

392
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,770
worthwhile experiment we just ran and

393
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,050
the results of the experiment is the

394
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,030
null hypothesis ie we shouldn't keep

395
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,100
doing that great let's go on to the next

396
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,350
one you reward them in that moment you

397
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,630
don't punish them for admitting that the

398
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,250
result of the experiment was the null

399
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,790
hypothesis that's often the answer

400
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,890
run an experiment but that's not how

401
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,720
most corporations work that's not how

402
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,570
people feel when they go to work in the

403
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,250
morning they want to get an atta boy

404
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,720
from their peers they want to get an

405
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,460
atta boy from their manager if they

406
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,650
can't get one by saying my thing didn't

407
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,900
work they will not say my thing did not

408
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:35,000
work hey uh dr. Ted oh forget our talk

409
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,090
so add a question so does moonshots work

410
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,400
on problems like starvation and hunger I

411
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,320
mean can we ever solve real problems

412
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,800
today with technology like starvation

413
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,880
hunger as an example sure I don't have a

414
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,580
ready solution for starvation and hunger

415
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,860
but I don't think that any problem is

416
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,380
immune to moonshot thinking so at least

417
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,880
the way we would define it in X a

418
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,070
moonshot has three basic components

419
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,200
there has to be a huge problem with the

420
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,180
world that you can name and you want to

421
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,190
address you have just named a huge

422
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,800
problem in the world the second is you

423
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,900
have to have a radical proposed solution

424
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,600
to that problem not radical because you

425
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,120
want to be cool and get cool points in

426
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,940
the world for having been weird but in

427
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,160
the spirit of trying to go to a new

428
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,170
place to try something that people

429
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,450
haven't tried to not just be in a

430
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,340
smartness contest with everyone else

431
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,200
who's tried to address the problem but

432
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,790
to be in more of a bravery and

433
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,310
creativity contest with the problem

434
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,710
itself so that's the second thing having

435
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,540
a radical foreclosed solution and then

436
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,280
the third at least as we would define it

437
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,050
but I suppose there other ways of

438
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,090
dressing problems but EDX we would say

439
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,160
that the third problem the third aspect

440
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,660
that you have to bring in order for it

441
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,820
to be a moonshot is you have to present

442
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,000
some kind of breakthrough technology or

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,100
proposed set of technologies which

444
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,080
brought together would be a breakthrough

445
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,030
that would enable this science-fiction

446
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,430
sounding product or service that would

447
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,680
solve that problem put in that way

448
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,960
there's no reason that you couldn't

449
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,590
solve starvation and hunger using those

450
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,950
tools and I hope you do thank you you

451
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,540
just described some of the criteria for

452
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,490
what makes a good project but where do

453
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,590
the projects come from originally and

454
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,149
how do you go through vetting

455
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:25,609
them and forming like a more long-term

456
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:28,909
project so I could imagine other ways of

457
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,889
doing it roughly the way it feels that x

458
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:34,099
is there's a huge pile of ideas on the

459
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:37,099
metaphoric table anyone can put them on

460
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:39,529
the table and by the way we have a

461
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:42,080
mechanism where you guys can submit on

462
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,139
our website moonshot ideas to X and

463
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:47,359
we're very happy to take them from any

464
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,359
in all places because we believe that

465
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,779
ideas by themselves raw technologies by

466
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,639
themselves they're worth something but

467
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:58,580
they don't reliably turn into something

468
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,399
great that the work that's really

469
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,460
special happens primarily after the idea

470
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,580
so we have this huge pile of ideas on

471
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,589
the table there isn't an actual table

472
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:13,190
right and then a lot of the fail fast a

473
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,469
lot of the work is how do you pick

474
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:17,119
through all these things on the table

475
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,389
and throw them away as fast as possible

476
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,909
as efficiently as possible but for good

477
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:25,339
reasons not for fake reasons if you're

478
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:27,440
like I don't like that one it's easy to

479
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,820
take it off the table but you haven't

480
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,259
actually added any value that's not a

481
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,869
good reason if you pick one off the

482
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,700
table and you say hey look this one

483
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,109
breaks the second law of thermodynamics

484
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,149
I think we can throw that one away

485
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:40,460
without further discussion oh look this

486
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,249
one is made of unobtainium right so we

487
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:46,609
can throw that one away sadly not all of

488
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,229
them can be removed from the table as

489
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:50,899
easily as those and so you often have to

490
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,399
do real work sometimes you have to build

491
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:54,229
prototypes you have to talk to the

492
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:56,659
people who act in that ecosystem and say

493
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,450
if we built this thing would it solve

494
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,820
the problem and then they say not really

495
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,679
well that's good to know thank goodness

496
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,269
we didn't spend a huge amount of time

497
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:07,279
and money building the thing only to

498
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,929
discover at the end that that wasn't

499
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,339
really going to solve the problem in the

500
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:13,789
world so that is one of the main muscles

501
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,969
at X is how do you get people both to

502
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,649
feel good about throwing stuff on to the

503
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:21,289
table and feel good about taking it back

504
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,479
off the table and the best-case scenario

505
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,099
which has happened a few times that X is

506
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:27,440
when the both happen in the same meeting

507
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,369
when someone gets a brownie point from

508
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,619
me or from others for having brought up

509
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:36,920
a beautiful idea and in the same meeting

510
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,220
throw the idea way and gets two pieces

511
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,900
of brownie point that's failing fast

512
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,550
when they feel like they got brownie

513
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,720
points for putting on the table and

514
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,760
taking it off in a half an hour meeting

515
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,300
so I was about to pass this question but

516
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,120
then when you said that don't regret it

517
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,690
tomorrow that's why I came in here good

518
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,090
so both of you are people who have

519
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,980
created the kind of impact which

520
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,530
everyone here wants to create in their

521
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:15,170
lives but my question is that suppose

522
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,360
you have a person like me I have figured

523
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,010
out that this is my passion this is the

524
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,700
problem I want to solve but along the

525
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,100
side I need to stay relevant I need to

526
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,990
know the current affairs I need to know

527
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,620
like read TechCrunch wired Business

528
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,780
Insider there's like so many resources

529
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,110
and all of them creating so much new

530
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,130
information every day that if I spend

531
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,010
time reading those I won't solve my

532
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,200
problem I won't be doing my job so my

533
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,170
question to you is along with following

534
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,130
your passion how do you spend your time

535
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,320
and keep yourself updated so not you

536
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,960
know these answers will be probably

537
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,000
popular with you guys but not popular

538
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,460
with much of the rest of the world but I

539
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,990
feel pretty strongly about both of them

540
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,360
the first one is I got lucky I won't

541
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,840
speak for Sebastian but I got lucky and

542
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,750
I I hope that you guys are calibrated on

543
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,640
that that the people who are the most

544
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,250
successful usually worked fairly hard

545
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,100
and they have some skill that wasn't

546
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,480
entirely luck but do not believe that

547
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
there is not a huge amount of luck

548
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,650
involved or hold yourself to a standard

549
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,630
as though there were not a huge amount

550
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,490
of luck involved it will drive you crazy

551
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,140
totally unfairly the second thing is I

552
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,590
don't read business books actually

553
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,600
mostly I read The Economist every

554
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,690
week but I mostly don't even read the

555
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,309
news especially now it's driving me

556
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:03,530
crazy you know what I spend time doing I

557
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,830
talk to people and I really listen to

558
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,140
them the things that I was describing

559
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,169
about how X is set up that's not taken

560
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,870
from some great business book I read I'm

561
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,419
actually managing people and I'm really

562
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,270
paying attention to what moves their

563
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,480
needle it's like this observation is

564
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,570
just watching people and saying like oh

565
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,460
I told you to do that and you're doing

566
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,830
this why are you doing that you just go

567
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,190
ask them I have behaviors that you won't

568
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,809
read about in a business book but I

569
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,760
didn't get them from a business book or

570
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,500
any collection of them for example

571
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,080
here's one of my mantras if you come

572
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,059
into my office and you tell me I'm an

573
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,179
idiot I will say the first words out of

574
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,280
my mouth will absolutely be thank you

575
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,110
and very likely I will come around the

576
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,330
table and give you a hug because if you

577
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,280
don't do that that will be the last time

578
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,440
that person ever says anything hard to

579
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,299
you and probably the last time anyone in

580
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,610
the organization ever says anything hard

581
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,440
and therefore important for you to know

582
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,500
to you but that's an observation about

583
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,770
humans and like what how they operate so

584
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,289
i strongly believe that there's a ton

585
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,940
that can be learned from working hard

586
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,190
being open to the fact that you're wrong

587
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,690
a lot of the time because we're all

588
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,510
wrong a lot of the time and really

589
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,580
listening to the people around you they

590
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,470
have a lot to teach you so that doesn't

591
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,620
mean never read any books but I think

592
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,150
that the idea that you can somehow

593
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,150
program yourself by cleverly picking the

594
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,700
one percent of the fire hose of data

595
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,740
that's coming at you and only listen to

596
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,960
that one percent is a bit of a fantasy

597
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,659
thank you yeah my question is a little

598
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:46,400
bit in line with that so that's a

599
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,830
fireside chats or personal questions

600
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,990
okay I think so obviously you are you

601
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,929
Jen spiration and very successful what

602
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:59,120
you are doing is there anything you had

603
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,429
to stop doing or anything you had to

604
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:04,100
sacrifice during during that time

605
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,169
yeah I mean I've certainly had to

606
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:11,900
sacrifice a lot of things but a few of

607
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,280
them that have been particularly hard

608
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,190
for me for example I'm a people pleaser

609
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,210
I like to resolve conflict and I'm

610
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,480
physically feel you know sick might be

611
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,660
an exaggeration but uncomfortable when

612
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,299
people around me fight even if they work

613
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:31,910
for me I feel bad about it obviously

614
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,549
that's totally dysfunctional for me to

615
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,830
be running an organization when I can't

616
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,679
be direct and have conflict with people

617
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,150
it's really important that I'd be able

618
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,950
to do that so that's an example of

619
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,549
something that I have learned how to do

620
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:48,740
when I have mantras and structures for

621
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,080
emotional structures that to get me to

622
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,370
do it and to do it quickly in fact but

623
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,900
it still doesn't feel very good when I

624
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,970
do it and that's the sort of thing I

625
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,190
kind of wish I didn't come out

626
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,100
card-carrying nerd and yet I don't

627
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,530
actually spend very much in my time on

628
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,510
those things that's another sacrifice I

629
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,980
want to end up actually tinkering and

630
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,630
like thinking some the new stuff I'm an

631
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,580
entrepreneur I went to like actually run

632
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,320
one of the projects that X there's a

633
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,610
real sense in which I actually don't

634
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,980
want the job that I have the reason that

635
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,890
I'm doing it is because I believe that

636
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm nurturing this group of people and

637
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,210
making something possible that wouldn't

638
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,950
be possible otherwise and that gives me

639
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,049
a real sense of purpose even though on a

640
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:34,730
day-to-day basis it's kind of not what

641
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,320
would be most fun for me so that's

642
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,059
another example thank you I Sebastian hi

643
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,299
Astra I'm curious is if yes think that

644
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,340
there is a opportunity to create a

645
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,150
start-up around I like a dating

646
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,490
application that uses machine learning

647
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,650
aii because we all know divorce is like

648
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,760
a giant problem in our country but maybe

649
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,559
that uses like Google glass or something

650
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,200
to create perfect mashes or do you think

651
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,760
I just have totally letting Sebastian

652
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:11,590
take this one great question haha

653
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,080
hey what was the question build it do

654
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,669
you think like I start there could be

655
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:20,470
like a start-up like kind of like tender

656
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,419
that uses machine learning in AI to

657
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,880
create like perfect great relationship

658
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,730
so you can avoid divorce in the future

659
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:36,460
I'm so let me let me let me just answer

660
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,789
this differently the number of emails I

661
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,520
get forever stupid reason mostly from

662
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,990
German stands out because there was in

663
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,730
German television some futuristic show

664
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,940
of people who build contraptions that

665
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,730
solve climate change and make clocks go

666
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,669
backwards is huge and sometimes right we

667
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,860
nuts to see their people like spend so

668
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,320
much time inventing things I look at

669
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,159
them and say why maybe I mean fixing

670
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,240
divorces physical thing but what I often

671
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,760
find is that people are taken by a

672
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,029
technical idea they find oma whatever

673
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,399
the sake combined I'm going to pull your

674
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,159
long to say you say tinder with machine

675
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,399
learning it's a technical idea but for

676
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,429
me the first step is always to think

677
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:33,070
about the problem so give an example on

678
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,470
i have a lot of robotics colleagues some

679
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,240
very prominent one on the room here and

680
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,909
any robotics professor takes the dogma

681
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:44,710
that all problems in the world are

682
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,190
solved by robots right so you'd go for

683
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,580
example and would say I bit humanoid

684
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,159
robots and what can they do well how

685
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,649
about elderly care all of Japanese

686
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:58,360
robotics I have revenue does is like

687
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,070
that they have done it for 20 years put

688
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,200
a human robots because since the bidding

689
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,260
human items must be useful right and it

690
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,610
must use for something so use for

691
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,799
everything let me find the most useful

692
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,590
thing is a daily care and incumbent

693
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,760
immunity a what do you think about if I

694
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,080
can start a company on robots for

695
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,789
elderly care they have two legs and

696
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:18,070
they're obviously that sounds great

697
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,860
let's do one little excursion okay

698
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,169
suppose you want to solve the elderly

699
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:24,820
care product project problem the ones

700
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,520
you want to solve

701
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,100
whatever that one is let's think what's

702
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,890
the best solution for that problem if it

703
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,750
still involves the robots inside your

704
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,440
company all right so suppose you're

705
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,910
going to solve the divorce problem in

706
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,380
this country you really want to solve it

707
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,150
went fewer divorces say for whatever

708
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,360
reason then let's take out what is the

709
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,220
best solution with this problem and if

710
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,720
you come I would think it's machine

711
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,970
learning on tinder then did it oh yeah I

712
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,800
think that's a fine answer I would also

713
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,370
say that you know machine learning and

714
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,180
tinder might not make our list at X but

715
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,440
the general answer a text would be how

716
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,840
fast how long does it take for you to

717
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,180
think about it and talk to people and

718
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,220
how long does it take for you to make a

719
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,680
prototype of it because if you can make

720
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,450
a prototype of it really fast the right

721
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,400
answer might be don't worry about it

722
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,250
just like make it and try it you'd be

723
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,800
amazed what making it and trying it like

724
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,540
maybe it's going to go supernova and you

725
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,070
don't have to have these arguments with

726
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,690
idiots who don't understand it like us

727
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,930
were maybe it turns out that it's

728
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,790
actually not a good idea and then

729
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,320
that'll be the fastest way to discover

730
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,850
that it's not a good idea so that's not

731
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,340
always the right thing to do but that

732
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,260
one sounds like you could prototype

733
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,570
something so fast that it might actually

734
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,610
be faster to just make it instead of

735
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,630
trying to figure out whether you're

736
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,650
right or not unfortunately really

737
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,570
unfortunately out of time in a few

738
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,840
seconds left absolutes in so bad really

739
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,140
thank you I want to end by saying that

740
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,430
don't isn't that just so funny that's

741
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,490
exactly what I was going to say so when

742
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,830
i started at x a long time ago I

743
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:16,370
reported to Sebastian and he gave me so

744
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,860
he was my manager and I really admire

745
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,460
you fashion and I just want to leave

746
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,590
these guys with something that I think

747
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,780
about and I know you said it

748
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,250
tongue-in-cheek and I'm going to say it

749
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,290
partly to tease you but I also mean it

750
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,940
sincerely to them and I know you meant

751
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,730
it sincerely Tim to me the first and

752
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,740
only really sincere feedback that

753
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,809
Sebastian ever gave me

754
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,200
as my manager was don't listen to your

755
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:49,009
manager and and you were good at it and

756
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:54,980
you were good at it and and and

757
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,629
ironically that was such important

758
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:03,679
feedback for me that it's really stuck

759
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,389
with me and it's part of why I admire

760
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:07,789
you thank you for being a guide for me

761
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:10,549
and for all of us my manager sits over

762
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:12,649
there and I can see how it's cringing

763
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,970
request haha exactly what to do so thank

764
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:25,670
