00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:27,360
hi again hi I farid after all it's my

3
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:29,610
unbelievable pleasure on a privilege to

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,899
present my best friend's longtime friend

5
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:38,070
Astro teller grand sum of instantly many

6
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:43,230
noble Lords of similar names head of

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:46,229
Google X now x less and general genius

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,440
and wonderful human being to you some of

9
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:56,760
you might know him but welcome thank you

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:58,739
very much my very first question I can't

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,859
have with what's this with this jacket

12
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,220
this is just what I put on this morning

13
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,590
but in fact I got this jacket I think

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,710
someone was trying to prank me they gave

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,060
me this jacket and I mean in Craig

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,880
Barrett who at the time also worked at

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,180
alphabet a matching jacket it wasn't an

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,830
r2d2 jacket it was a wiki jacket so it

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,420
had like the bandolier across here and

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,670
like the pull up the hood and was all

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,350
fuzzy and he just said no way I'm not

22
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,300
wearing that's because we were going to

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,340
spend a day I'm seeing an event kind of

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,440
like this together that he didn't wear

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,840
it and I just thought you know it's a

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,940
little bit lame I I'm gonna wear my r2d2

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,320
jacket so even though I mean I'm into

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,830
Star Wars but I'm not super into Star

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,360
Wars but if I work for the day just for

30
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,070
fun I don't know and then I got into it

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,020
I'm just enjoying being a robot i guess

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,450
i guess they were you robots just

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,610
kidding but you just joined us as a

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,970
hiring partner yes we did that is great

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,970
too

36
00:01:53,330 --> 00:02:01,460
I think shortly after I got fired I

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,520
think this became the best place to walk

38
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:10,190
into the gevalia milk that's a total

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,650
coincidence Oh what are you hiring um

40
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,480
well we hired lots of things we're

41
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,060
certainly hiring roboticists we care a

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,790
lot about machine learning a lot of the

43
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,160
work that we do at x is systems

44
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,130
integration work we don't do a lot of

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,990
basic science essentially but we work on

46
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,090
problems that haven't been solved before

47
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:33,410
and so a lot of that turns out to be

48
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:36,170
complex iterative system integration

49
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,550
kind of work taking pieces that already

50
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,040
exists in the world sometimes that

51
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,930
custom versions of them have to be made

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,150
and putting together in unusual ways

53
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,670
getting it out in the world trying

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,100
you've discovered that you're wrong and

55
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,780
you make a new design you repeat is the

56
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,180
sort of general way that it feels I

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,590
think for all of the X projects so

58
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,040
people who are good at that I want it I

59
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,840
want it I want to take you 50 years in

60
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,540
the future tell me what's gonna be in

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,340
tossing let's go I don't obey this law

62
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,360
what's gonna be interesting in 50 years

63
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:11,510
I ideas I think the world is going to be

64
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,269
almost unrecognizable in 20 so it's been

65
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,970
a bad I'm sure it'll be a mix i think

66
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,800
mainly it'll be a pretty exciting and

67
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,360
mostly positive place i'm sure it's

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,100
going to be disorienting getting there

69
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,900
they'll talk about a nuclear winter i

70
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,720
don't know i think that the world is

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,730
going to turn out to surprise us more

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,010
positively than negatively but the world

73
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,890
is going to be incredibly different 20

74
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,170
years the saying is and i think that

75
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,750
this is correct that people tend to

76
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,540
overestimate the progress of Technology

77
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,180
and the rate of change in the short term

78
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,560
that is three years from now they think

79
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,410
the world would be more different than

80
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,530
it is and they underestimate it in the

81
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,600
medium term over 10 to 20 years I think

82
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,730
we all collectively can't really imagine

83
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,890
how different it will be my rule of

84
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,959
thumb would be 20 years from now ought

85
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,120
to be roughly like a hundred years in

86
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,760
the past so if you can imagine the last

87
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,800
hundred years of change and next twenty

88
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,250
I think that that's probably a realistic

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,900
estimate

90
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,940
for how different the world will feel

91
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,790
wow that means people have to have done

92
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,549
a lot along the way yes I think our

93
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,170
society is not yet wired for the rate of

94
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,269
change that we're going to be

95
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,340
experiencing well I think it always

96
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,820
impresses me on yours is your attitude

97
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:28,880
towards innovation and specifically

98
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,970
things like fear and failure and so on

99
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,310
you celebrate when you fire people over

100
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,200
in for its fears that correct yeah i

101
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,620
mean i'm not sure we would celebrate

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,900
letting someone go though sometimes it

103
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,540
is the case that we helped people to go

104
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,419
to a place that is better for them and i

105
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,360
have at least on occasion had them

106
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,050
deliberate them yes absolutely it is

107
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,360
sometimes the case that you know Susie

108
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,700
can be great somewhere but the place she

109
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,419
currently is is not where she can be

110
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:06,169
great and it is a favor to Susie's team

111
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:08,570
and to myself but also to Susie to tell

112
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,130
that to Susie certainly not telling her

113
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,590
that and letting her just suffer

114
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,030
indefinitely being not excellent when

115
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,950
she has the capacity to be excellent

116
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,870
it's not doing anybody particularly

117
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,479
Susie a favor he doing despite a baby

118
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,580
auto students the clear liberating all

119
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,320
of them you can be graduate them yes

120
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,360
well I didn't anything with our projects

121
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,220
yes yes Stanford doesn't remember we

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,360
have these wonderful pompous moment

123
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,010
seven we take out every student I think

124
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,450
the parents come just elevator with him

125
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:40,940
about this feature that's why we call a

126
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,140
graduation for the project and X so

127
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,360
instead of feeling like they're being

128
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,650
kicked out of Eden they feel a little

129
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,919
bit more like they're leaving home and

130
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,169
going to college hopefully i skeeve

131
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,000
blankie before a NASA does want a

132
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,390
question and I want to ask you the same

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,090
question um I want you to go back to

134
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,940
your 18 years 18 years old self when you

135
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:06,440
just enter in college what advice would

136
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:09,470
you give yourself you know one of the

137
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,810
things that I think about frequently if

138
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,940
I could go back and change something it

139
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,680
was a little moment but it's become

140
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,000
actually bigger for me over time instead

141
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,710
of smaller I was a junior so maybe nine

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,980
twenty-something what 20 years old

143
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,360
probably at Stanford and my brother had

144
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,820
just got into Stanford he was a freshman

145
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,400
he was doing an undergraduate degree in

146
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,440
physics but he was spending actually

147
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,110
more of his time doing acting being a

148
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,350
thespian than being doing his physics

149
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,300
degree and I was getting to know his

150
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,090
mentor whose name's winter Meade and

151
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,190
after one of the show's winter came up

152
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,200
to me and he said you'd be great in the

153
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,030
theater you should really join the

154
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,240
company and do something and I said oh

155
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,000
no I'm really busy I had some set of

156
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,530
excuses and I was really busy that's not

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,270
why i said no i was afraid i just i

158
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,730
don't know i think was probably because

159
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,340
it was important to me and I've

160
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,840
regretted that ever since not because I

161
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,970
want to be in the theater it just

162
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,490
bothers me it's one of the few things in

163
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,800
my life I didn't do because I was afraid

164
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,050
and I know I didn't do it because I was

165
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,330
afraid and I thought ever since i'm not

166
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,010
doing that i can fail for all kinds of

167
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,560
reasons but i'm not going to fail again

168
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,630
cuz i was just too afraid to try so now

169
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,280
when you afraid you do it yeah I am

170
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,970
actually counter phobic and how can you

171
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,979
drive a car I'm not afraid to track a

172
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:39,530
car I really actually but I'm not yet to

173
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:41,690
run a red light different story you've

174
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:45,350
done an unbelievably amazing job as the

175
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:48,200
queue of Silicon Valley the magician who

176
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,910
puts balloon into the stratosphere still

177
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,360
self-driving cars and whatever it is

178
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,690
that you've been doing in X what is your

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,340
vessel thank you too and maybe I take a

180
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,540
tiny bit of credit as well but what's

181
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:05,090
your recipe no so true to this

182
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,030
organization evolves and matures and

183
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,919
quite frankly gets larger in size to

184
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:14,600
keep it fresh how do you keep like the

185
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:20,060
innovative genes going I think a lot

186
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:22,610
about all the tensions that we have at X

187
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,050
and some of the tensions are fairly

188
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,660
straightforward some of them less

189
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:30,200
straightforward but for example we have

190
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,930
to have raging optimism or we would

191
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,649
never try the things that we try but if

192
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,139
you just

193
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,509
power people have raging optimism go

194
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:40,579
forth be crazy the crazier the better

195
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:43,249
without limit you are not going to get

196
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:46,790
good results so there has to be a kind

197
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:50,329
of scathing paranoia and skepticism that

198
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,649
balances out that optimism you have to

199
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,410
keep those in balance if you're actually

200
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,059
going to get what you want but that's

201
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,110
not the only kind of tension that we

202
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:01,519
have another one is the you know what

203
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,949
you could say positively would be to

204
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,689
support structures at X or if you want

205
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:08,569
to be negative about it the bureaucracy

206
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:11,389
at X so we want to bring to bear on

207
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:14,480
projects the right help at the right

208
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,759
time to amplify them or to help you know

209
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,350
move them on to a better path when

210
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,410
they're sort of veering off of the path

211
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,819
in the best-case scenarios that's

212
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,529
wonderful of course it sounds really

213
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:26,029
positive the way I just said that but if

214
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,249
it's done wrong it sure feels like

215
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,290
bureaucracy to the project leads and

216
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:32,240
they sometimes express that to me and

217
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,459
the bureaucracy is the last thing that I

218
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,160
want to produce so that's another

219
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,569
example where having no structure

220
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,649
doesn't make any sense then we're just a

221
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,300
venture capitalist we're just giving

222
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,279
people money and walking away that

223
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,949
actually makes sense for us to do that

224
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,660
but if we smother them with attention if

225
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:49,730
I think that I know how to do their job

226
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,860
better than them one of us is redundant

227
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,639
like that's a bad plan so getting that

228
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,889
light touch is another example where it

229
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,029
both ends of the spectrum are bad and

230
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,620
there's somewhere in the middle that's

231
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:05,089
right and we're always sort of searching

232
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,519
for it many a lot of students and

233
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,920
partners came from I think over 20

234
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:15,050
countries it is amazing including places

235
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,299
as always Jordan Estonia what is the

236
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,559
magic of Silicon Valley and what can you

237
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:22,069
take home for different countries

238
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,620
there's something in the water here

239
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:27,079
that's certainly palpable I think for

240
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,399
the people at engler take I'm not

241
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:31,070
actually suggesting taking the water

242
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,950
home you know what

243
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,990
one of the ways that is not my favorite

244
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,890
phraseology but I've heard it frequently

245
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,110
is a culture of creative destruction and

246
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,760
so that's not what I would take home but

247
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,220
I think that that's what you might hear

248
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,850
frequently one of the ways i might

249
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:53,240
prefer it would be a healthy embrace of

250
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:56,450
failure so someone was just asking me as

251
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,240
a korean newspaper as asking me how can

252
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:03,770
the companies in Korea do better they

253
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:07,400
feel really afraid to take risks because

254
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,990
they might look bad and I don't know

255
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,780
this is true but this was a suggestion I

256
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,930
gave yesterday morning to this reporter

257
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:18,830
to take back to companies in Korea which

258
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,180
was it's not that we want to look bad in

259
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,900
Silicon Valley I don't think that's it

260
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,160
at all but I'm willing to look

261
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:30,410
arbitrarily stupid right now if that's

262
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,870
what it takes to win in the long run I

263
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,900
think it's a time horizon difference if

264
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,930
you understand and can connect that

265
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:42,020
being open to being wrong now is the

266
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,120
essence of learning and that learning is

267
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,230
the superpower that causes you to win

268
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:51,170
then you become hungry to be wrong and

269
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,270
to start over and to try new things now

270
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,640
no matter how imperfect it makes you

271
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,730
look in the short term because your time

272
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,880
horizon on which you're unwilling to

273
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,950
lose is very long and so I think even

274
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,590
though there is a culture of speed in

275
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:09,050
Silicon Valley I believe that the length

276
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,390
of the time horizon over which people

277
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,070
are trying to optimize themselves being

278
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,250
longer may actually be part of the

279
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,800
secret sauce we have microphones and I

280
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,960
want to open up for audience question in

281
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,490
a minute so if you want to line up

282
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,070
between these two microphones piece as

283
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,870
usual but I have one question by

284
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,610
dividing up tell us about his son like

285
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,670
so he's referring to the fact that my

286
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,560
son finished his first nanodegree a

287
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,230
little over a year ago his name is

288
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,790
Griffin teller and he did the

289
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,410
introduction of computer science he

290
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,440
really enjoyed it he was

291
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:50,220
just during 12 when he finished it and

292
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,480
he's struggling his way here working

293
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,519
hard and our little struggling might not

294
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,550
be fair even through the machine

295
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,350
learning course and i just had

296
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,269
sebastian's I told Sebastian this over

297
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,949
dinner last week and he said oh that's

298
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,509
actually one of the really hard courses

299
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,550
and I went home they said you know

300
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,500
Griffin you're going pretty slowly

301
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,939
through it Sebastian says that's one of

302
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,259
the really hard ones you want to ask for

303
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:12,449
help do you want to switch to one that's

304
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,310
easier he's like no no I got it I

305
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,750
justice I have to like go back and like

306
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,310
learn a whole bunch of extra mass every

307
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:23,399
time I get to the next stage 13 now so

308
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,610
but I'm very very grateful to Udacity

309
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,610
because Griffin's a brave boy and he's

310
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,560
hard-working and he's focused but that

311
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,360
by itself i was just saying back in the

312
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,339
green room wouldn't actually have

313
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,629
translated to something like this i

314
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,339
don't think it's an accident that he's

315
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:40,740
not doing chemistry or physics or

316
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,350
history there isn't a platform for

317
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,019
supporting him doing that and Udacity

318
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,579
has actually provided him with just the

319
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,370
right kind of structure so he has to

320
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,750
work hard he can self paces learning it

321
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,100
means a huge amount to him you should

322
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,199
actually part of why I'm here today yeah

323
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,910
we have over 20 recruiter both sides and

324
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,759
I think you should bring him here and

325
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:03,060
coke again excellent otherwise over

326
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:09,180
tuition tax this start in the center

327
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:11,550
hello dr. teller could you perhaps share

328
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,670
a little bit about the use of

329
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:17,160
reinforcement learning in hedge fund

330
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,709
reinforcement learning in which domain

331
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,180
in hedge fund or financial hedge fund

332
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:28,439
I'm not sure reinforcement learning is

333
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:33,779
the only issue let me answer or

334
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:36,360
generally the time I believe where the

335
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:39,930
application of machine learning in many

336
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,339
domains to the individual problems as

337
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,079
posed by humans is ending it'll go away

338
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,360
over you know 10 or 20 years it won't

339
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,459
happen overnight the thing which is

340
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,750
starting to be the case and one of the

341
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,639
areas in which you can see this

342
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,790
happening is hedge funds is where the

343
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,570
questions themselves are being asked by

344
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,540
machine learn

345
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,040
now it often won't look like and machine

346
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,300
learning being you know deep nets and

347
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,980
reinforcement learning and a number of

348
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,650
other tools it's sometimes won't look

349
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,010
like the question is being asked but

350
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:13,950
when you do end-to-end learning of any

351
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,200
kind in any domain you are essentially

352
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:20,040
leaving up to the system that's doing

353
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,710
the learning more of the decomposition

354
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,320
of the problem to the computer to the

355
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,840
learning system that that's part of the

356
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,850
task the feature izing of the data the

357
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,890
decomposition of the problem that's what

358
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,050
humans used to do and so I think that

359
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,290
movement is something we're going to see

360
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,480
a lot more of at computers essentially

361
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,150
starting to ask the questions and

362
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,370
structure the problem as well as

363
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,780
actually solving the problem and hedge

364
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,390
funds is definitely one of the areas in

365
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,390
which that's happening all right thank

366
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:54,960
you so much would you summarize your

367
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:59,190
view of failure on failure as fail fast

368
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,670
learn faster yeah I mean fail fast is

369
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,920
lip service which is thrown around very

370
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,900
liberally all around the valley and

371
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,960
other places and I think it largely does

372
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,550
not get people what they want and so

373
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,160
there's something wrong with the term

374
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:17,640
fail fast but that and the dollar fifty

375
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,220
will get you on the bus the problem is

376
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,710
that there's the lip service of whatever

377
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,690
you say like fail fast and then there's

378
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,760
the actual way that people behave and

379
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,590
the reason that those pointers are so

380
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,380
different is because these are the

381
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:34,200
emotional paths of least resistance in

382
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,870
your organization and you can say fail

383
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,880
fast until the cows come home but if you

384
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,070
punish people in fact if you do anything

385
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,170
short of actively rewarding them when

386
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,840
they fail it doesn't matter that you say

387
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,540
fail fast so what do you mean it when

388
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,600
you say fail fast and so we have

389
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,460
mechanisms at X to reward people when

390
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,770
they stand up and they say that was a

391
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,050
worthwhile experiment we just ran and

392
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:00,030
the results of the experiment is the

393
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,100
null hypothesis ie we shouldn't keep

394
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,350
doing that great let's go on to the next

395
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,630
one you reward them in that moment you

396
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,250
don't punish them for admitting that the

397
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,790
result of the experiment was the null

398
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,890
hypothesis that's often the answer

399
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,720
run an experiment but that's not how

400
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,570
most corporations work that's not how

401
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,250
people feel when they go to work in the

402
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,720
morning they want to get an atta boy

403
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,460
from their peers they want to get an

404
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,650
atta boy from their manager if they

405
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,900
can't get one by saying my thing didn't

406
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:35,000
work they will not say my thing did not

407
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:38,090
work hey uh dr. Ted oh forget our talk

408
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,400
so add a question so does moonshots work

409
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,320
on problems like starvation and hunger I

410
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,800
mean can we ever solve real problems

411
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,880
today with technology like starvation

412
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,580
hunger as an example sure I don't have a

413
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,860
ready solution for starvation and hunger

414
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,380
but I don't think that any problem is

415
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,880
immune to moonshot thinking so at least

416
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,070
the way we would define it in X a

417
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,200
moonshot has three basic components

418
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,180
there has to be a huge problem with the

419
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,190
world that you can name and you want to

420
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,800
address you have just named a huge

421
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,900
problem in the world the second is you

422
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,600
have to have a radical proposed solution

423
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,120
to that problem not radical because you

424
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,940
want to be cool and get cool points in

425
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,160
the world for having been weird but in

426
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,170
the spirit of trying to go to a new

427
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,450
place to try something that people

428
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,340
haven't tried to not just be in a

429
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,200
smartness contest with everyone else

430
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,790
who's tried to address the problem but

431
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,310
to be in more of a bravery and

432
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,710
creativity contest with the problem

433
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,540
itself so that's the second thing having

434
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,280
a radical foreclosed solution and then

435
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,050
the third at least as we would define it

436
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,090
but I suppose there other ways of

437
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,160
dressing problems but EDX we would say

438
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,660
that the third problem the third aspect

439
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,820
that you have to bring in order for it

440
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,000
to be a moonshot is you have to present

441
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,100
some kind of breakthrough technology or

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,080
proposed set of technologies which

443
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,030
brought together would be a breakthrough

444
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,430
that would enable this science-fiction

445
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,680
sounding product or service that would

446
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,960
solve that problem put in that way

447
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,590
there's no reason that you couldn't

448
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:15,950
solve starvation and hunger using those

449
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:17,540
tools and I hope you do thank you you

450
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,490
just described some of the criteria for

451
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,590
what makes a good project but where do

452
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,149
the projects come from originally and

453
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,609
how do you go through vetting

454
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:28,909
them and forming like a more long-term

455
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:30,889
project so i could imagine other ways of

456
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:34,099
doing it roughly the way it feels that x

457
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:37,099
is there's a huge pile of ideas on the

458
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:39,529
metaphoric table anyone can put them on

459
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:42,080
the table and by the way we have a

460
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:45,139
mechanism where you guys can submit on

461
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,359
our website moonshot ideas to X and

462
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:50,359
we're very happy to take them from any

463
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,779
in all places because we believe that

464
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,639
ideas by themselves raw technologies by

465
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:58,580
themselves they're worth something but

466
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:01,399
they don't reliably turn into something

467
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,460
great that the work that's really

468
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:07,580
special happens primarily after the idea

469
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,589
so we have this huge pile of ideas on

470
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,190
the table there isn't an actual table

471
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:15,469
right and then a lot of the fail fast a

472
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,119
lot of the work is how do you pick

473
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:20,389
through all these things on the table

474
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,909
and throw them away as fast as possible

475
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:25,339
as efficiently as possible but for good

476
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:27,440
reasons not for fake reasons if you're

477
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,820
like I don't like that one it's easy to

478
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,259
take it off the table but you haven't

479
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,869
actually added any value that's not a

480
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:34,700
good reason if you pick one off the

481
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:36,109
table and you say hey look this one

482
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,149
breaks the second law of thermodynamics

483
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,460
I think we can throw that one away

484
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:43,249
without further discussion oh look this

485
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,609
one is made of unobtainium right so we

486
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:48,229
can throw that one away sadly not all of

487
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:50,899
them can be removed from the table as

488
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:52,399
easily as those and so you often have to

489
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:54,229
do real work sometimes you have to build

490
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:56,659
prototypes you have to talk to the

491
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:59,450
people who act in that ecosystem and say

492
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:01,820
if we built this thing would it solve

493
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,679
the problem and then they say not really

494
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,269
well that's good to know thank goodness

495
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,279
we didn't spend a huge amount of time

496
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,929
and money building the thing only to

497
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,339
discover at the end that that wasn't

498
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:13,789
really going to solve the problem in the

499
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:16,969
world so that is one of the main muscles

500
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:18,649
at X is how do you get people both to

501
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:21,289
feel good about throwing stuff on to the

502
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:23,479
table and feel good about taking it back

503
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,099
off the table and the best-case scenario

504
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:27,440
which has happened a few times that X is

505
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:31,369
when the both happen in the same meeting

506
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,619
when someone gets a brownie point from

507
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:36,920
me or from others for having brought up

508
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:40,220
a beautiful idea and in the same meeting

509
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,900
throw the idea way and gets two pieces

510
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,550
of brownie point that's failing fast

511
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,720
when they feel like they got brownie

512
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,760
points for putting on the table and

513
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:53,300
taking it off in a half an hour meeting

514
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:56,120
so I was about to pass this question but

515
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,690
then when you said that don't regret it

516
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:05,090
tomorrow that's why I came in here good

517
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:06,980
so both of you are people who have

518
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,530
created the kind of impact which

519
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:15,170
everyone here wants to create in their

520
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:17,360
lives but my question is that suppose

521
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,010
you have a person like me I have figured

522
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,700
out that this is my passion this is the

523
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,100
problem I want to solve but along the

524
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,990
side I need to stay relevant I need to

525
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,620
know the current affairs I need to know

526
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,780
like read TechCrunch wired Business

527
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,110
Insider there's like so many resources

528
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:40,130
and all of them creating so much new

529
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:43,010
information every day that if I spend

530
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,200
time reading those I won't solve my

531
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,170
problem I won't be doing my job so my

532
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,130
question to you is along with following

533
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:57,320
your passion how do you spend your time

534
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:59,960
and keep yourself updated so not you

535
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,000
know these answers will be probably

536
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,460
popular with you guys but not popular

537
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,990
with much of the rest of the world but I

538
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:11,360
feel pretty strongly about both of them

539
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:14,840
the first one is I got lucky I won't

540
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,750
speak for Sebastian but I got lucky and

541
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,640
I I hope that you guys are calibrated on

542
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:25,250
that that the people who are the most

543
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,100
successful usually worked fairly hard

544
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,480
and they have some skill that wasn't

545
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,640
entirely luck but do not believe that

546
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,650
there is not a huge amount of luck

547
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,630
involved or hold yourself to a standard

548
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,490
as though there were not a huge amount

549
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:45,140
of luck involved it will drive you crazy

550
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:48,590
totally unfairly the second thing is I

551
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,600
don't read business books actually

552
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,690
mostly I read The Economist every

553
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,309
week but I mostly don't even read the

554
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:03,530
news especially now it's driving me

555
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:06,830
crazy you know what I spend time doing I

556
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:09,140
talk to people and I really listen to

557
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:12,169
them the things that I was describing

558
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,870
about how X is set up that's not taken

559
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:17,419
from some great business book I read I'm

560
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:20,270
actually managing people and I'm really

561
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:23,480
paying attention to what moves their

562
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:26,570
needle it's like this observation is

563
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,460
just watching people and saying like oh

564
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,830
I told you to do that and you're doing

565
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:34,190
this why are you doing that you just go

566
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,809
ask them I have behaviors that you won't

567
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,760
read about in a business book but I

568
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,500
didn't get them from a business book or

569
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,080
any collection of them for example

570
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,059
here's one of my mantras if you come

571
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,179
into my office and you tell me I'm an

572
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:49,280
idiot I will say the first words out of

573
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,110
my mouth will absolutely be thank you

574
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,330
and very likely i will come around the

575
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,280
table and give you a hug because if you

576
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,440
don't do that that will be the last time

577
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,299
that person ever says anything hard to

578
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,610
you and probably the last time anyone in

579
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,440
the organization ever says anything hard

580
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,500
and therefore important for you to know

581
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,770
to you but that's an observation about

582
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:12,289
humans and like what how they operate so

583
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,940
i strongly believe that there's a ton

584
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,190
that can be learned from working hard

585
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,690
being open to the fact that you're wrong

586
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,510
a lot of the time because we're all

587
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,580
wrong a lot of the time and really

588
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,470
listening to the people around you they

589
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,620
have a lot to teach you so that doesn't

590
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,150
mean never read any books but i think

591
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,150
that the idea that you can somehow

592
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:34,700
program yourself by cleverly picking the

593
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,740
one percent of the fire hose of data

594
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,960
that's coming at you and only listen to

595
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:44,659
that one percent is a bit of a fantasy

596
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,400
thank you yeah my question is a little

597
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,830
bit in line with that so that's a

598
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,990
fireside chats or personal questions

599
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:56,929
okay I think so obviously you are you

600
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,120
Jen spiration and very successful what

601
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:01,429
you are doing is there anything you had

602
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,100
to stop doing or anything you had to

603
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:09,169
sacrifice during during that time

604
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:11,900
yeah I mean I've certainly had to

605
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:13,280
sacrifice a lot of things but a few of

606
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,190
them that have been particularly hard

607
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:20,210
for me for example I'm a people pleaser

608
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:23,480
I like to resolve conflict and I'm

609
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:26,660
physically feel you know sick might be

610
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,299
an exaggeration but uncomfortable when

611
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,910
people around me fight even if they work

612
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:34,549
for me I feel bad about it obviously

613
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,830
that's totally dysfunctional for me to

614
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,679
be running an organization when I can't

615
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,150
be direct and have conflict with people

616
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,950
it's really important that I'd be able

617
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,549
to do that so that's an example of

618
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:48,740
something that I have learned how to do

619
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:51,080
when I have mantras and structures for

620
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,370
emotional structures that to get me to

621
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,900
do it and to do it quickly in fact but

622
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,970
it still doesn't feel very good when I

623
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,190
do it and that's the sort of thing I

624
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,100
kind of wish I didn't come out

625
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,530
card-carrying nerd and yet I don't

626
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,510
actually spend very much in my time on

627
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:12,980
those things that's another sacrifice I

628
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:14,630
want to end up actually tinkering and

629
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,580
like thinking some the new stuff I'm an

630
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,320
entrepreneur I went to like actually run

631
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,610
one of the projects that X there's a

632
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,980
real sense in which I actually don't

633
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,890
want the job that I have the reason that

634
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm doing it is because I believe that

635
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,210
I'm nurturing this group of people and

636
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,950
making something possible that wouldn't

637
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,049
be possible otherwise and that gives me

638
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,730
a real sense of purpose even though on a

639
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,320
day-to-day basis it's kind of not what

640
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:41,059
would be most fun for me so that's

641
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:44,299
another example thank you I Sebastian hi

642
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:46,340
Astra I'm curious is if yes think that

643
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:50,150
there is a opportunity to create a

644
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:52,490
start-up around I like a dating

645
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,650
application that uses machine learning

646
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:58,760
aii because we all know divorce is like

647
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,559
a giant problem in our country but maybe

648
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,200
that uses like Google glass or something

649
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,760
to create perfect mashes or do you think

650
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:11,590
I just have totally letting Sebastian

651
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:17,080
take this one great question haha

652
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:18,669
hey what was the question build it do

653
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,470
you think like I start there could be

654
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,419
like a start-up like kind of like tender

655
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,880
that uses machine learning in AI to

656
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:27,730
create like perfect great relationship

657
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:36,460
so you can avoid divorce in the future

658
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:42,789
I'm so let me let me let me just answer

659
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:45,520
this differently the number of emails I

660
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,990
get forever stupid reason mostly from

661
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,730
German stands out because there was in

662
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,940
German television some futuristic show

663
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:54,730
of people who build contraptions that

664
00:28:51,940 --> 00:29:00,669
solve climate change and make clocks go

665
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:02,860
backwards is huge and sometimes right we

666
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:05,320
nuts to see their people like spend so

667
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:09,159
much time inventing things I look at

668
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:13,240
them and say why maybe I mean fixing

669
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,760
divorces physical thing but what I often

670
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,029
find is that people are taken by a

671
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,399
technical idea they find oma whatever

672
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:24,159
the sake combined i'm going to pull your

673
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:27,399
long to say you say tinder with machine

674
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,429
learning it's a technical idea but for

675
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:33,070
me the first step is always to think

676
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:35,470
about the problem so give an example on

677
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,240
i have a lot of robotics colleagues some

678
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:42,909
very prominent one on the room here and

679
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:44,710
any robotics professor takes the dogma

680
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:48,190
that all problems in the world are

681
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,580
solved by robots right so you'd go for

682
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,159
example and would say I bit humanoid

683
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,649
robots and what can they do well how

684
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,360
about elderly care all of Japanese

685
00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:00,070
robotics I have revenue does is like

686
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,200
that they have done it for 20 years put

687
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:05,260
a human robots because since the bidding

688
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,610
human items must be useful right and it

689
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,799
must use for something so use for

690
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,590
everything let me find the most useful

691
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,760
thing is a daily care and incumbent

692
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,080
immunity a what do you think about if I

693
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,789
can start a company on robots for

694
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,070
elderly care they have two legs and

695
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:20,860
they're obviously that sounds great

696
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:23,169
let's do one little excursion okay

697
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,820
suppose you want to solve the elderly

698
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,520
care product project problem the ones

699
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,100
you want to solve

700
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,890
whatever that one is let's think what's

701
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,750
the best solution for that problem if it

702
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:36,440
still involves the robots inside your

703
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,910
company all right so suppose you're

704
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,380
going to solve the divorce problem in

705
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,150
this country you really want to solve it

706
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:44,360
went fewer divorces say for whatever

707
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,220
reason then let's take out what is the

708
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,720
best solution with this problem and if

709
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:52,970
you come I would think it's machine

710
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,800
learning on tinder then did it oh yeah I

711
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:58,370
think that's a fine answer I would also

712
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:02,180
say that you know machine learning and

713
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:06,440
tinder might not make our list at X but

714
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:08,840
the general answer a text would be how

715
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,180
fast how long does it take for you to

716
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,220
think about it and talk to people and

717
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,680
how long does it take for you to make a

718
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,450
prototype of it because if you can make

719
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,400
a prototype of it really fast the right

720
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:22,250
answer might be don't worry about it

721
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,800
just like make it and try it you'd be

722
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,540
amazed what making it and trying it like

723
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,070
maybe it's going to go supernova and you

724
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,690
don't have to have these arguments with

725
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,930
idiots who don't understand it like us

726
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:34,790
were maybe it turns out that it's

727
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,320
actually not a good idea and then

728
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,850
that'll be the fastest way to discover

729
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,340
that it's not a good idea so that's not

730
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,260
always the right thing to do but that

731
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,570
one sounds like you could prototype

732
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,610
something so fast that it might actually

733
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,630
be faster to just make it instead of

734
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:51,650
trying to figure out whether you're

735
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:53,570
right or not unfortunately really

736
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:56,840
unfortunately out of time in a few

737
00:31:53,570 --> 00:32:00,140
seconds left absolutes in so bad really

738
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:04,430
thank you I want to end by saying that

739
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:07,490
don't isn't that just so funny that's

740
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:09,830
exactly what I was going to say so when

741
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:16,370
i started at x a long time ago I

742
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:18,860
reported to Sebastian and he gave me so

743
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,460
he was my manager and I really admire

744
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,590
you fashion and I just want to leave

745
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,780
these guys with something that I think

746
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,250
about and I know you said it

747
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,290
tongue-in-cheek and I'm going to say it

748
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,940
partly to tease you but I also mean it

749
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,730
sincerely to them and I know you meant

750
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,740
it sincerely Tim to me the first and

751
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,809
only really sincere feedback that

752
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,200
Sebastian ever gave me

753
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:49,009
as my manager was don't listen to your

754
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:54,980
manager and and you were good at it and

755
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:59,629
you were good at it and and and

756
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:03,679
ironically that was such important

757
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:05,389
feedback for me that it's really stuck

758
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,789
with me and it's part of why I admire

759
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:10,549
you thank you for being a guide for me

760
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:12,649
and for all of us my manager sits over

761
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:16,970
there and I can see how it's cringing

762
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:19,509
request haha exactly what to do so thank

763
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,509
